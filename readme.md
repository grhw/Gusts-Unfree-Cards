# Gust's Unfree Cards
A Balatro mod where I add all things I thought would be fun. Not as unbalanced as other mods, but there's definitely some unbalancing gonna happen.

Uses Lovely and Steamodded (SMODS).

## Installation
- Go to Releases
- Download the zip file of any version
- Put in your mods directory (Look for another mod to tell you where that is, I think SMODS has it.)
- Unzip it. Make sure the mods folder has the directory named `GustsUnfreeCards`.

## Build from source
It's not your typical Balatro mod source, it's a little more readable.

You build through `./main.py` and all the source code is in `src/`. I'm sure you can figure it out from there.
pip requirements aren't there (yet), but it's pillow and shutil (i think its built-in, not sure).

## TODO
- Automatic Joker list in the readme
